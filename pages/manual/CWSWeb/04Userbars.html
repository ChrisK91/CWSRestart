<p><i>The userbars above is a static image and will not update.</i></p>
<p>Userbars are small images, that display your server status. You can include them in forums, on websites, in signatures and every other place you can think of. Userbars require statistics to be enabled. Userbars are available via <code>http://your-server-ip:8181/Files/userbar.png</code>.</p>
<h3 class="subheading">Customization</h3>
<p>The template that is used to create your userbar is located in the subfolder <i>Content</i> in the CWSWeb directory. There you will find a file called <i>base.png</i> and a font called <i>font.ttf</i>. You can replace <i>base.png</i> with a custom header. You can chose the size freely, however I recommend at least 25px height and 550px width. If you go below these sizes some text might get cut off. If you want to use a diffrent font, just replace the <i>font.ttf</i>. The gray rectangle with the text has a height of 25px.</p>
