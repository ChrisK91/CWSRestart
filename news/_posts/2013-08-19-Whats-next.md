title: What's next?

I have to admit. I didn't really post much stuff in the last days in the CWSRestart topic. So here is the current development status:

I restructured a ton of code and added a fair decent of comments, to improve readbility of my code. When the semester is starting again, I won't have the time I currently spent on CWSRestart. This is why I thought I should make my code a little bit cleaner. I still have some classes on my to do list, but I hope that I have the code in a solid state this week.

Feature wise there isn't really much on my list right now. As you can see on the [bugtracker](https://github.com/ChrisK91/CWSRestart/issues?state=open&labels=enhancement), there are only some minor things, mainly some additional MITM improvements. If you want to see a feature, just comment below or add a ticket to the bugtracker!
