            <h3>Features</h3>
            <h4 class="subheader">Lightweight</h4>
            <p>CWSRestart is build with performance in mind. The CPU and Memory footprints are very low. In it fullest configuration, CWSRestart will use around 40MB of your RAM. The CPU usage will usually sit at 0%. When checks are performed this value might rise for a short time, but it tends to stay well under 5%.</p>
            <h4 class="subheader">Stability</h4>
            <p>CWSRestart is proven to be stable with internal error handling. It can easily run for hundreds of hours without leaking memory or crashing.</p>
            <h4 class="subheader">Multiple checks</h4>
            <p>CWSRestart can check your server on multiple levels. It can validate if the server process is still running. In addition, CWSRestart can connect to the server and make sure that it is still responding to requests.</p>
            <h4 class="subheader">Independant of your server version &amp; highly configurable</h4>
            <p>CWSRestart does not hook into the server, it only uses server independant functions. This means, that you can modify the server.exe as you wish. Every check that is performed by CWSRestart can be tuned via custom settings.</p>
            <h4 class="subheader">Access control</h4>
            <p>CWSRestart can help you to control access to your server. You can kick players and enforce whitelists/blacklists. You can even target full IP ranges.</p>
            <h4 class="subheader">Statistics</h4>
            <p>Do you want to know who is online or how much memory your server used? CWSRestart can store statistics in a SQLite database. These statistics can &dash; of course &dash; be read by other programs.</p>
            <h4 class="subheader">Modular</h4>
            <p>CWSRestart has a modular architecture and can be expanded with additional software. Do you want a web interface to remotely manage your server? CWSWeb has you covered. Do you want to see playernames? Just get CubeWorldMITM.</p>
