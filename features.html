          <p>CWSRestart was created, to make hosting a CubeWorld-Server easier. Currently, the Server is not really stable, so it crashes from time to time. CWSRestart can be used to check on multiple levels, if the server is still healthy.</p>
          <h2>Current features:</h2>
          <h4>Multiple server checks</h4>
          <p>CWSRestart will perform two types of checks, to make sure your server is still running. First, it will go ahead and see, if the process is still alive. In addition, CWSRestart will attempt to connect to the server via multiple networks. This way we can make sure, that your server is still responding.</p>
          <h4>Lightweight</h4>
          <p>CWSRestart is developed with CPU and RAM usage in mind. I will try to keep a minimal, yet extendable core, that fits your need while keeping CPU and RAM usage to a minimum</p>
          <h4>Statistics</h4>
          <p>If you want, you can keep track on your server statistics. CWSRestart will &dash; on your command &dash; start collectiong statistics about the number of players, the CPU and RAM usage, and a few more numbers. These numbers are stored in a comma seperated file to allow you further analysis.</p>
          <h4>Access lists</h4>
          <p>Do you want a private server? No problem. CWSRestart can enforce whitelists, allowing you to host a private server for your community. Or you can create a blacklist instead.</p>
          <h4>Automated restarting</h4>
          <p>If the server isn't passing required tests, it will be restarted. CWSRestart will try to perform a gracefule shutdown: it will try to send the letter <i>q</i> to allow the server to quit. If this won't work, the process is terminated. You can select how you want to restart the server. By default, you want to use the standard <i>Server.exe</i>. However, CWSRestart also supports custom actions. For instance, you can chose to start the server via a <i>.bat</i>-file that sends you an e-mail, or you can start the server through the launcher of your choice</p>
          <h4>Open source</h4>
          <p>CWSRestart is licensed under the GPL v3. You can see how everything is done. Most of the server logic is moved into a sperate DLL, to allow you to create your own projects. <small>You might need to check, how the GPL impacts your projects.</small></p>
          <h2>Possible future features</h2>
          <p>CWSRestart is very much a work in progress. It is stable, however I'll try to add features that the users want to see. Here is a list of possible future features. This is more of an idea list. Features listed here might not make it into a future version.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Implement some form of process-to-process communication. This should allow me to create advanced features, that don't need to be in the main project. <i>Upcoming feature</i></li>
              <li>Expose statistics to the web, include a web interface. When process to process communication is in place, I want to include a (purely optional) web server. This server should allow you to manage the settings remotely, and add statistics to your website.</li>
              <li>Add more detailed statistics</li>
          </ul>
