# Tools for CWSRestart
Here you can find some tools, to help you get started with CWSRestart

## Setup PowerShell Script
You can use this script, to unblock downloaded files and add a Windows-Firewall setting for port 8181. Download the file and place it in either the CWSRestart, CWSWeb or MITM folder. Then `cd` to the location, where this script is stored in a PowerShell console (I recommend launching PS as Administrator right away). Then you can start the script with `.\Setup.ps1`.
