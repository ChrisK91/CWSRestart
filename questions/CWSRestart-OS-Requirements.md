I test all my builds on a Windows 8 Professional x64 machine. In addition, I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 VM, where I test the tools as well. However, the compatibility is given be the .Net Framework 4.5. This supports Windows Vista SP2, Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 (everything in x64 and x86).

Feature such as kicking and banning require administrative privileges.
